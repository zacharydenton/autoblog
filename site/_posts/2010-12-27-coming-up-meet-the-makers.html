<div><p>I am often asked how decisions are made for WordPress, who&#8217;s involved in decision-making, and how the open source project is structured in general. WordPress is a meritocracy, meaning that anyone can get involved, and a combination of the quality of someone&#8217;s contributions and their level of interest/time commitment will determine how much influence they have over decisions. Because these factors vary, we have several levels of contributors to the core WordPress application, ranging from full-time lead developers to casual one-patch contributors.</p>
<p>I loved it when that Intel commercial in 2009 gave Ajay Bhatt, co-inventor of the USB, some recognition as a rock star of geekland (though I hated it that it wasn&#8217;t actually Ajay Bhatt, but an actor &#8212; way to kill the message, Intel).<sup>1</sup> In WordPress-land, most people know who Matt Mullenweg is, but most of the other leaders and contributors are much less visible. Moving forward, I&#8217;m going to be posting profiles here of some of our more dedicated contributors.</p>
<p>Why now? We&#8217;re coming up on the second annual WordPress core leadership meetup in January 2011, and we&#8217;re thinking we&#8217;ll hold a video town hall at some point during our time together. Between now and then the profiles I post will be of the core developers who will be at the meetup. After that, I&#8217;ll be branching out and posting about other contributors, including developers, designers, forum moderators, etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post here in January when we have dates/times set for the video town hall. In the meantime, you can submit questions for us to answer then in the forum thread <a title="Suggestions thread" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/what-should-2011-hold-for-wordpress" rel="nofollow">What Should 2011 Hold for WordPress?</a></p>
<p>To get a sense of how all these people fit together and how decisions are made, you can check out the presentation I did at WordCamp Portland in October on <a title="How WordPress Decisions Get Made video" href="http://wordpress.tv/2010/09/18/jane-wells-how-wordpress-decisions-get-made/" rel="nofollow">How WordPress Decisions Get Made</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><sup>1 &#8211; And how lame is it that Conan O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s interview with the real Ajay Bhatt is no longer available on the The Tonight Show&#8217;s website, and everyone&#8217;s embedded videos are blank? I found a copy of it <a title="Conan interviews the real Ajay Bhatt" href="http://vimeo.com/10662430" rel="nofollow">here</a>. And here&#8217;s the <a title="Intel rock star commercial" href="http://video.intel.com/?fr_story=8d8f50ebfdded3db4eb14514d66e4f9628f653b5&amp;rf=sitemap" rel="nofollow">original Intel commercial</a> if you were living under a rock and never saw it. <img src="http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></sup></p></div>
