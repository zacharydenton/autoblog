<div><p>The first release candidate (RC1) for WordPress 3.1 is now available.</p>
<p>An RC comes after the beta period and before final release. That means we think we&#8217;re done. We currently have no known issues or bugs to squash. But with tens of millions of users, a variety of configurations, and thousands of plugins, it&#8217;s possible we&#8217;ve missed something. So if you haven&#8217;t tested WordPress 3.1 yet, now is the time! Please though, not on your live site unless you&#8217;re extra adventurous.</p>
<p>Things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul><li>With <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.1" rel="nofollow">nearly 700 tickets closed</a>, there are tons of changes. Plugin and theme authors, <strong>please test your plugins and themes now</strong>, so that if there is a compatibility issue, we can figure it out before the final release.</li>
<li><strong>Users</strong> are also encouraged to test things out. If you find problems, let your plugin/theme authors know so they can figure out the cause.</li>
<li>If any known issues crop up, you&#8217;ll be able to <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5" rel="nofollow">find them here</a>.</li>
</ul><p>If you are testing the release candidate and think you&#8217;ve found a bug, there are a few ways to let us know:</p>
<ul><li>Post it to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/" rel="nofollow">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a></li>
<li>Report it to the <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers" rel="nofollow">wp-testers mailing list</a></li>
<li>Join the development IRC channel and tell us live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev</li>
<li>File a bug ticket on the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow">WordPress Trac</a></li>
</ul><p>To test WordPress 3.1, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" rel="nofollow">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (you&#8217;ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.1-RC1.zip" rel="nofollow">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>We <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/11/wordpress-3-1-beta-1/" rel="nofollow">released</a> WordPress 3.1 Beta 1 on Thanksgiving, so it&#8217;s only fitting that the release candidate comes as a Christmas present. Happy holidays and happy testing!</p>
