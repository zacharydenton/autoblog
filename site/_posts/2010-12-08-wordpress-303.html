<div><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" rel="nofollow">WordPress 3.0.3 is available</a> and is a security update for all previous WordPress versions.</p>
<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0.3" rel="nofollow">This release</a> fixes issues in the remote publishing interface, which under certain circumstances allowed Author- and Contributor-level users to improperly edit, publish, or delete posts.</p>
<p><strong>These issues only affect sites that have remote publishing enabled.</strong></p>
<p>Remote publishing is disabled by default,&#160;but you may have enabled it to use a remote publishing client such as one of the WordPress mobile apps. You can check these settings on the &#8220;Settings &#8594; Writing&#8221; screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" rel="nofollow">Download 3.0.3</a> or update automatically from the &#8220;Dashboard &#8594; Updates&#8221; screen in your site&#8217;s admin area.</p></div>
