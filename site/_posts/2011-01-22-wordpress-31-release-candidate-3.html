    Unfortunately, with more testing came realizations that there were too many major bugs and usability issues with how the functionality was implemented, so we&#8217;ve spent the last week rolling back the most important portions of the feature.

<div><p> WordPress 3.1 Release Candidate 3 is now available. After careful evaluation of the 3.1 features of RC2, we realized the need to make some adjustments. There are some important differences from previous versions of 3.1, so <strong>you can read the</strong> changes if you have developed for a beta or RC version. </p><p> The biggest change is the removal of AJAX list tables, which was an attempt to move all of our list-style screens to full AJAX pagination, search and sort column and to consolidate the list-style displays to a single API that plugins could use. Unfortunately, with more testing came realizations that there were too many major bugs and usability problems with the functionality was implemented, so we have spent the last week to roll back the main elements of the function. </p><ul><li> <strong>For users:</strong> AJAX has been totally disabled for the list tables. We hope to get it back again, in a form that is properly and fully applied in future versions. Column sorting remain, but everything else is back to its 3.0 state. </li><li> <strong>For developers:</strong> The whole list table API is now marked <em>private.</em> If you try to take advantage of new components of the API, you&#39;re pretty much guaranteeing that your plugins will break in a future version, so you do not do it. <img src="http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley"> We hope to be able to do all the fun new goodies for general use in a future version. </li></ul><p> This is the only way we could prevent regressions in functionality and usability of WordPress 3.0 to 3.1. That&#39;s right, users and plugin writers can still do everything you used to do (and then some). </p><p> Because of the code churn between RC2 and RC3, <strong>release candidate, this must be a lot of testing.</strong> Each list screen-tested. In particular, the comment moderation screen testing, especially with keyboard shortcuts (if you did not know about them, now&#39;s your chance to try them). </p><p> Other patches in the RC3 includes: </p><ul><li> Correctly display the author shortcut menu Quick Edit </li><li> Various important fixes to the many variables taxonomy question </li><li> Fixes to the theme of the removal process </li><li> Fixes to the pages that are used for posts </li><li> IIS and Multisite: Do not restore the web.config to save permalink </li><li> Properly validate mail format and their rewrite rules </li></ul><p> I assemble a group of friends in Washington, DC, this weekend to test WordPress 3.1 and provide feedback. We&#39;d love to see this idea catching among friends at coffee shops around the world. (We will be blogging our results, and we are thinking of using hashtag # wptest on Twitter.) If you test the release candidate and believe that you have found a bug, there is no way to tell us: </p><ul><li> Post on the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/" rel="nofollow">Alpha / Beta area of support forums</a> </li><li> Report it to the <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers" rel="nofollow">wp-testers mailing list</a> </li><li> Participate in the development IRC channel and talk live on irc.freenode.net # wordpress-dev </li><li> A bug ticket on the <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow">WordPress Trac</a> </li></ul><p> In order to test WordPress 3.1, try the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" rel="nofollow">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (you will want to &quot;bleeding edge Night Lies&quot;). Or you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.1-RC3.zip" rel="nofollow">download the release candidate here</a> (zip). </p><p> We will study this issue carefully to see where we can improve our internal processes in the future. With this, our requisite haiku, written by Jane: </p><p> Pulling in AJAX - <br> Sometimes you need to step back <br> and show some restraint. </p><p> Happy testing! </p></div>
