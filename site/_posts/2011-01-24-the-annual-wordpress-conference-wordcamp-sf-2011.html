This year will mark the fifth anniversary of the word camp, and as always will include Matt Mullenweg&#39;s &quot;State of the Word&quot; address, and a host of great speakers that you normally only get to see the expensive industry conferences. This year the program will be expanded to three days, with programming for publishers, bloggers and developers. There are also activities, such as summits Core Group, Workshops for contributors, designers and local organizers and the various professional and networking. The planning is just beginning, so save the date in your diary and keep an eye on the <a title="Word Camp SF 2011" href="http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/" rel="nofollow">Word camp SF 2011</a> site (and / or follow <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/WordCampSF" rel="nofollow">@ wordcampsf</a> Twitter account) for updates as details become available. </p><p> * For persons who attended Word Camp SF last year who thought the annual event this year would be called WordCon, with the word camp SF become more locally focused event, you can read <a title="What&#39;s in a name?
