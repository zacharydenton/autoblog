<div><p>The second release candidate for WordPress 3.1 is now available. The requisite haiku:</p>
<p>Rounding up stragglers<br>
Last few bugs for 3.1<br>
Go test RC2</p>
<p>As I outlined in <a title="WordPress 3.1 Release Candidate" href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/12/wordpress-3-1-release-candidate/" rel="nofollow">the announcement post for RC1</a>, release candidates are the last stop before the final release. It means we think we&#8217;re done, and we again have no bugs to squash. But with tens of millions of users, many server configurations and setups, and thousands of plugins and themes, it&#8217;s still possible we&#8217;ve missed something.</p>
<p>Beta 1 came on Thanksgiving, RC1 on Christmas, and RC2 on New Year&#8217;s Day. We won&#8217;t be waiting for another holiday for the final release, though, so <strong>if you haven&#8217;t tested WordPress 3.1 yet, now is the time!</strong></p>
<p>Select changes since RC1:</p>
<ul><li>The security fixes included in WordPress 3.0.4</li>
<li>Fix issues related to handling a static front page</li>
<li>Fixes and enhancements for the pagination buttons</li>
<li>Fix searching for partial usernames</li>
<li>Properly reactivate plugins after editing them</li>
<li>Always show the current author in the author dropdown when editing a post</li>
<li>Fixes for attachment taxonomies</li>
<li>Fix node removal for the admin bar</li>
<li>Fix the custom post type show_in_menu argument</li>
<li>Various fixes for right-to-left languages</li>
<li>and <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/trunk/?action=stop_on_copy&amp;mode=stop_on_copy&amp;rev=17204&amp;stop_rev=17149&amp;limit=100&amp;verbose=on" rel="nofollow">a few dozen more changes</a></li>
