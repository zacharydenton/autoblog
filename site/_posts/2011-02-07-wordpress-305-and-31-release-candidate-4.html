<div><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" rel="nofollow">WordPress 3.0.5</a> is now available and is a security hardening update for all previous WordPress versions.</p>
<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0.5" rel="nofollow">This security release</a> is required if you have any untrusted user accounts, but it also comes with important security enhancements and hardening. All WordPress users are strongly encouraged to update.</p>
<p>Three point oh point five<br>
Enhances security<br>
Three point one comes soon</p>
<p>The release addresses a number of issues and provides two additional enhancements:</p>
<p><strong>Two moderate security issues</strong> were fixed that could have allowed a Contributor- or Author-level user to gain further access to the site.</p>
<p><strong>One information disclosure issue</strong> was addressed that could have allowed an Author-level user to view contents of posts they should not be able to see, such as draft or private posts.</p>
<p><strong>Two security enhancements</strong> were added. One improved the security of any plugins which were not properly leveraging our security API. The other offers additional defense in depth against a vulnerability that was fixed in previous release.</p>
<p>Thanks to Nils Jueneman and Saddy for their private and responsible disclosures to security@wordpress.org for two of the issues. The others were reported or repaired by our security team.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" rel="nofollow">Download 3.0.5</a> or update automatically from the Dashboard &gt; Updates menu in your site&#8217;s admin area. Please update immediately.</strong></p>
<hr><h3>WordPress 3.1 Release Candidate 4 is also now available.</h3>
<p>The Release Candidate 4  build includes the security fixes and enhancements included in 3.0.5 and addresses about two dozen additional bugs. This includes fixes for:</p>
<ul><li>Deleting a user and reassigning their posts to another user.</li>
<li>Marking multiple users or sites as spam in multisite.</li>
<li>PHP4 compatibility.</li>
</ul><p>As outlined in <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/01/wordpress-3-1-release-candidate-3/" rel="nofollow">previous</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2011/01/wordpress-3-1-release-candidate-2/" rel="nofollow">RC</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/12/wordpress-3-1-release-candidate/" rel="nofollow">posts</a>, if you are testing the release candidate and think you&#8217;ve found a bug, there are a few ways to let us know:</p>
