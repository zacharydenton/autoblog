<div><p> Haikus from Jane on her 39th Birthday: </p><blockquote><p> Practice makes perfect <br> is what they say about things, <br> but sometimes it is not. </p><p> In this case, it is <br> not practice without refinement; <br> and then more testing. </p><p> You can help to WordPress! <br> Now: 3.1, beta 2 <br> are here, means-testing. </p><p> But! Remember this: <br> <strong>Simply install the experimental areas</strong> <br> as YMMV. </p></blockquote><p> The second beta of WordPress 3.1 is now available! </p><p> For things to try, please read our <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/11/wordpress-3-1-beta-1/" rel="nofollow">Beta 1 release date announced</a> . A <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5" rel="nofollow">list of known issues</a> is available on our bug tracker. </p><p> Already have a test install what you want to switch over to the beta? <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" rel="nofollow">Try beta tester plugin</a> . Test 3.1 at a test site, not on the active site, such as interaction with plugins that have not been updated can be unpredictable, and we can not predict (see how it works?) If something is broken or not ... that&#39;s why we ask people to help us test it! <img src="http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></p><p> Tester, do not forget to use the <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers" rel="nofollow">wp-testers mailing list</a> to discuss the errors that you encounter. Plugin and theme authors, please test your plugins for compatibility. </p><p> <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.1-beta2.zip" rel="nofollow">Download WordPress 3.1 Beta 2</a> now. </p></div>
