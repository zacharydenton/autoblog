<div><p> I am often asked how decisions are made for WordPress, which is involved in decision-making, and how open source project is structured in general. WordPress is a meritocracy, which means that anyone can get involved, and a combination of the quality of someone&#39;s contributions and the rate of interest and time commitment will determine how much influence they have over decisions. Because these factors vary, we have several levels of donors to the core WordPress application, ranging from full-time lead developer of casual one-patch contributors. </p><p> I loved it when the Intel commercial in 2009 gave Ajay Bhatt, co-inventor of the USB, some recognition as a rock star of geekland (though I hated it that it does not actually Ajay Bhatt, but an actor - a way to kill the message, Intel). <sup>1</sup> WordPress-country, most people know who is Matt Mullenweg, but most other managers and employees is much less visible. Forward, I will be posting profiles here on some of our more involved participants. </p><p> Why now? We will in the second annual WordPress core leadership meetup in January 2011, and we think we hold a town hall video at some point during our time together. Between now and then I post the profiles will be of the core developers who will be at the meetup. After that, I will give up and write about other donors, including developers, designers, moderator, etc. </p><p> I&#39;ll post here in January when we have dates / times set for the video town hall. In the meantime, you can submit questions for us to answer since the forum thread <a title="Draft thread" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/what-should-2011-hold-for-wordpress" rel="nofollow">What should the 2011 Hold for WordPress?</a> </p><p> To get an idea of how all these people fit together and how decisions are made, you can check out the presentation I made in MS Word Camp Portland in October on <a title="How WordPress Decisions Get Made Video" href="http://wordpress.tv/2010/09/18/jane-wells-how-wordpress-decisions-get-made/" rel="nofollow">how WordPress Decisions Get Made</a> <span>.</span> </p><p> <sup>1 - And how lame is it that Conan O&#39;Brien interview with the real Ajay Bhatt is no longer available on The Tonight Show&#39;s website, and all embedded videos are blank? I found a copy of it <a title="Conan interviews the real Ajay Bhatt" href="http://vimeo.com/10662430" rel="nofollow">here</a> . And here is <a title="Intel rock star commercial" href="http://video.intel.com/?fr_story=8d8f50ebfdded3db4eb14514d66e4f9628f653b5&amp;rf=sitemap" rel="nofollow">the original Intel commercial</a> , if you lived under a rock and never saw it. <img src="http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></sup> </p></div>
