<div><p>Mark your calendars: <a title="WordCamp San Francisco" href="http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org" rel="nofollow">WordCamp San Francisco</a>, the official annual WordPress conference, will be August 12-14, 2011. This year will mark the 5th anniversary of WordCamp, and as always will feature Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s &#8220;State of the Word&#8221; address as well as a variety of amazing speakers that you&#8217;d normally only get to see at expensive industry conferences. This year the program will be expanded to three days, with programming for publishers, bloggers, and developers. There will also be related activities, like core team summits, workshops &#160;for contributors, designers, and local organizers, and various professional and networking events. The planning is just beginning, so save the date on your calendar and keep an eye on the <a title="WordCamp SF 2011" href="http://2011.sf.wordcamp.org/" rel="nofollow">WordCamp SF 2011</a> site (and/or follow the&#160;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/WordCampSF" rel="nofollow">@wordcampsf</a> twitter account) for updates as details become available.</p>
<p>*For people who attended WordCamp SF last year who thought the annual event this year would be called WordCon, with WordCamp SF becoming a more locally-oriented event, you can read <a title="What's in a Name? WordCamp SF vs. WordCon" href="http://central.wordcamp.org/?p=1006" rel="nofollow">my long-winded explanation</a> of why we didn&#8217;t go that route over the on the WordCamp Central blog.</p></div>
