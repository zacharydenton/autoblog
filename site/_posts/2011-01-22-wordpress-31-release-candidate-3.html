<div><p>WordPress 3.1 Release Candidate 3 is now available. After careful evaluation of the 3.1 features in RC2, we recognized the need to make some adjustments. There are&#160;some significant differences from previous versions of 3.1, so <strong>please</strong> review the changes if you have been developing against a beta or RC version.</p>
<p>The biggest change is the removal of AJAX list tables, which had been an effort to move all of our list-style screens to full AJAX for pagination, searches, and column sorts, and to consolidate the list-style screens into a single API that plugins could leverage.&#160;Unfortunately, with more testing came realizations that there were too many major bugs and usability issues with how the functionality was implemented, so we&#8217;ve spent the last week rolling back the most important portions of the feature.</p>
<ul><li><strong>For users:</strong> AJAX has been entirely disabled for the list tables. We hope to bring this back again, in a form that is properly and fully implemented, in a future release. Column sorting remains, but everything else has returned to its 3.0 state.</li>
<li><strong>For developers:</strong> The entire list table API is now marked <em>private</em>. If you attempt to leverage new components of the API, you are pretty much guaranteeing that your plugins will break in a future release, so please don&#8217;t do that. <img src="http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley">  We hope to enable all the fun new goodies for public use in a future release.</li>
</ul><p>This is the only way we could prevent any regressions in functionality and usability from WordPress 3.0 to 3.1. That&#8217;s right, users and plugin authors can still do everything you used to be able to do (and a little bit more).</p>
<p>Because of the code churn between RC2 and RC3, <strong>this release candidate needs a lot of testing</strong>.&#160;Every list screen needs testing. In particular, the comment moderation screen needs testing, especially with keyboard shortcuts (if you didn&#8217;t know about those, now&#8217;s your chance to try them out).</p>
<p>Other fixes in RC3 include:</p>
<ul><li>Properly display the author dropdown in Quick Edit</li>
<li>Various important fixes to numerous taxonomy query variables</li>
<li>Fixes to the theme deletion process</li>
<li>Fixes to pages used for posts</li>
<li>IIS and Multisite: Avoid resetting web.config on permalink save</li>
<li>Properly validate post formats and their rewrite rules</li>
</ul><p>I&#8217;m assembling a group of friends in Washington, D.C., this weekend to test WordPress 3.1 and provide feedback. We&#8217;d love to see this idea catch on among friends at coffee shops around the world. (We&#8217;ll blog our results, and we&#8217;re thinking about using the hashtag #wptest on Twitter.)&#160;If you are testing the release candidate and think you&#8217;ve found a bug, there are a few ways to let us know:</p>
<ul><li>Post it to the&#160;<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/" rel="nofollow">Alpha/Beta area in the support forums</a></li>
<li>Report it to the&#160;<a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers" rel="nofollow">wp-testers mailing list</a></li>
<li>Join the development IRC channel and tell us live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev</li>
<li>File a bug ticket on the&#160;<a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow">WordPress Trac</a></li>
</ul><p>To test WordPress 3.1, try the&#160;<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" rel="nofollow">WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a> (you&#8217;ll want &#8220;bleeding edge nightlies&#8221;). Or you can&#160;<a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.1-RC3.zip" rel="nofollow">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to study this release carefully to see where we can improve on our internal processes in the future.&#160;With that, our requisite haiku, authored by Jane:</p>
<p>Pulling the AJAX &#8211;<br>
sometimes you need to step back<br>
and show some restraint.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p></div>
