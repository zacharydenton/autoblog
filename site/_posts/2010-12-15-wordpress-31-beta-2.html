<div><p>Haikus from Jane on her 39th birthday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Practice makes perfect<br>
is what they say about things,<br>
but sometimes it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>In this case it is<br>
not practice but refinement,<br>
and then more testing.</p>
<p>You can help WordPress!<br>
Now: 3.1, beta 2<br>
is here; needs testing.</p>
<p>But! Remember this:<br><strong>Only install on test sites</strong>,<br>
as YMMV.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second beta of WordPress 3.1 is now available!</p>
<p>For things to test, please review our <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2010/11/wordpress-3-1-beta-1/" rel="nofollow">Beta 1 release announcement</a>. A <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/5" rel="nofollow">list of known issues</a> can be found on our bug tracker.</p>
<p>Already have a test install that you want to switch over to the beta? <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" rel="nofollow">Try the beta tester plugin</a>.&#160;Please test 3.1 on a test site, not on your live site, as interactions with plugins that haven&#8217;t been updated may be unpredictable, and we can&#8217;t predict (see how that works?) whether something will break or not&#8230; that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re asking people to help us test everything! <img src="http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></p>
<p>Testers, don&#8217;t forget to use the <a href="http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers" rel="nofollow">wp-testers mailing list</a> to discuss bugs you encounter. Plugin and theme authors, please test your plugins for compatibility.</p>
