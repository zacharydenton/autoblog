<div><p> Version 3.0.4 of WordPress, instantly accessible via the update page in your dashboard or <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/" rel="nofollow">for download here</a> , is a very important update to apply to your sites as soon as possible because it contains a kernel security bug in our HTML sanitation, libraries, called KSES. I would rate this release as &quot;critical&quot;. </p><p> This issue affects all versions of WordPress before 3.0.4, so if you&#39;re still on a 2.x release you need to update also. </p><p> I appreciate an update during the holidays is no fun, but this is worth putting down the eggnog. In the spirit of the holidays, consider helping your friends, too. </p><p> If you are a security researcher, we appreciate you <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/17172/branches/3.0" rel="nofollow">taking a look at this changeset</a> , and review our updated. We have given it a lot of thought and review, but since this is so basic that we want as many brains in it as possible. Thanks <a href="http://www.sneaked.net" rel="nofollow">Mauro Gentile</a> and <a title="duck undah" href="http://joncave.co.uk" rel="nofollow">Jon Cave (duck_)</a> who discovered and alerted us to these XSS vulnerabilities first. </p></div>
